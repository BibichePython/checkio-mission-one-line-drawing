    Our Robots would be artists too. But as first they need practice to control left hand manipulators for smooth motions.
    For exercise they use to draw various figures with one rule -- <strong>don't lift your pen</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    A figure is represented as a set of segments in the rectangular coordinate system.
    Each segment is represented as a sequence of 4 numbers:
    (x<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;y<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;x<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;y<sub>2</sub>),
    where x<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;y<sub>1</sub> are coordinates for the first end and
    x<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;y<sub>2</sub> -- for the second.
    Segments are undirected. All points in a figure are connected, so you can reach each point from any point.
</p>

<p>
    You should find a path to draw the figure. You can pass each segment only once and don't lift your pen.
    The result must be represented as a sequence of points (tuples with coordinates) in the order how your pen is moving.
    The path can be started and ended in any points. If it's impossible to draw a figure then return an empty sequence.
    Let's look at examples.

    <img class="for_editor_only" title="figures" src="{{MEDIA}}figures.png" alt="figures" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    Example 1: the figure is represented as {(1,2,1,5),(1,2,7,2),(1,5,4,7),(4,7,7,5)} and can be
    two path - ((7,2),(1,2),(1,5),(4,7),(7,5)) or ((7,5),(4,7),(1,5),(1,2),(7,2)).<br>
    Example 2: the figure {(1,2,1,5),(1,2,7,2),(1,5,4,7),(4,7,7,5),(7,5,7,2),(1,5,7,1),(7,5,1,2)}
    can not be drawn with the given rules so results is an empty list or tuple.<br>
    Example 3: it's like fig.2 but with one more segment (1,5,7,5) and can be drawn several ways.
    One of them ((7,2),(1,2),(1,5),(4,7),(7,5),(7,2),(1,5),(7,5),(1,2)).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Figure segments as a set of tuples with 4 integers each.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The path as a list or tuple of tuples with 2 integers each.
